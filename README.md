# React to Weather

A simple weather app built with React - using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage

`$ npm install`

### Todo

- Use an address lookup api to convert a query to a lon/lat so we pull current weather from the one-call api
- Add a footer with links to inspiration (dark sku), resume, contact, github, and the odin project.
- Create a 'weather bar' using the hourly data provided by the 'one call'.
- Integrate map with weather tile layer (thats a tough one).
- Expose our OWM api keys or find a better place to host the project.
- Build a nice README.md to show off the project.

#### The Odin Project

Big shoutout to The Odin Project for the inspiration and resources which made this project possible.
