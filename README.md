# Mount Weather

A simple weather app built with React - using the OpenWeatherMap API.

## Usage

`$ npm install`

### Todo

- Use an address lookup api to convert a query to a lon/lat so we pull current weather from the one-call api
- Make mobile friendly
- Alter the head section (title, description, meta stuff)
- Allow user to switch between the two units of measurement (F & C)
- Create a 'weather bar' using the hourly data provided by the 'one call'.
- Integrate map with weather tile layer (thats a tough one).
- Build a nice README.md to show off the project.
